/*/////////////////////////
// A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three hours.
// The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part
// thereof in excess of three hours. The maximum charge for any given
// 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24
// hours at a time.
//
// Write a program that calculates and prints the parking charges for each of
// three customers who parked their cars in this garage yesterday.
// You should enter the hours parked for each customer. Your program should
// print the results in a neat tabular format and should calculate and print
// the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. The program should use the function
// calculateCharges to determine the charge for each customer. Your outputs
// should appear in the following format:
//
// Car        Hours        Charge
// 1            1.5             2.00
// 2            4.0             2.50
// 3            24.0           10.00
// TOTAL   29.5           14.50
